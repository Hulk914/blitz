Working on the front-end part (angular 2) and the middle layer (java) Also, scripting in shell and python as per requirement. Working with docker and kubernetes as well.\nSystem Engineer - Replaced the hardware security card used by the device of the telecommunications client with an open source FreeBSD license-based library (LibSRTP) so that the cost of external physical cards for encrypting RTP calls would come down hence reducing the build cost while leveraging the benefits of open source software.\nSystem Trainee Engineer - Created a website that could be accessed through mobile phones as well as computer (front end created to dynamically adjust to screen size) which would enable the administrator or manager to monitor the processes running on other systems in the network. Also, the person logged in to the web site would have the power to start new processes or end running processes in the systems connected to the network.\nSystem Trainee Engineer - On completing standard training with core stream as java and basic training in python I was given extra training in C/C++ in the networking domain. In Linux based environment using putty we created a transaction manager that utilized the concept of threads to use a single resource to transport messages between clients and server. Proper logging mechanisms were also created to handle unexpected errors.',
